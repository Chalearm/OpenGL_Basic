## Requirement

Hi, I’m looking for someone who can help me extend my program to 3D virtual jeep game using Open GL.
I will provide you with the basic program. The extended part are as follow:
1) Create one new object with colour and texture properties, and materials and they should be in reasonable location
2) Add pop-up menu to switch between different light properties (ambient,
diffuse, specular and position, point lights, directional lights, spotlights).
3) Use mouse to control object size, position and angle; and the camera too(size, position and angle)
4) Add and set light source to move around and react with surrounding environment.
5) The “game” should allow user to set window resolution, disable full screen
mode before or during the application.
6) Adding a creative, short story to the game would be nice:)

Lastly, I would like to have a demo video(without audio would be fine:)), and the sourcecode containing texture files and all necessary files. Adding a readme file would be nice too! For instructing me how to open and compile and execute the file

Thank you for your time, it would be nice if we can communicate along if you have any problems. I will send you the basic program after you reply! Thanks
